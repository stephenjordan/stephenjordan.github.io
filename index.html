<h2>Algebraic and Number Theoretic Algorithms</h2>

<b>Algorithm:</b> Factoring<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial<br /> 
<b>Description:</b> Given an <i>n</i>-bit integer, find the prime
factorization. The quantum algorithm of Peter Shor solves this in
\( \widetilde{O} (n^3) \) time
[<a href="#Shor_factoring">82</a>,<a href="#Shor_factoring94">125</a>]. 
The fastest known classical algorithm for integer factorization is the
general number field sieve, which is believed to run in time \(
2^{\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})} \). The best rigorously proven upper bound
on the classical complexity of factoring is \( O(2^{n/4+o(1)}) \) via the Pollard-Strassen algorithm 
[<a href="#Pol">252</a>, <a href="#Stras">362</a>]. Shor's
factoring algorithm breaks RSA public-key encryption and the
closely related quantum algorithms for discrete logarithms break the DSA
and ECDSA digital signature schemes and the Diffie-Hellman
key-exchange protocol. A quantum algorithm even faster than Shor's for
the special case of factoring &ldquo;semiprimes&rdquo;, which are
widely used in cryptography, is given in [<a href="#GLFB15">271</a>]. 
If small factors exist, Shor's algorithm can be beaten by a quantum 
algorithm using Grover search to speed up the elliptic curve factorization 
method [<a href="#PQRSA">366</a>]. Additional optimized versions of Shor's algorithm are given in [<a href="#EH17">384</a>, <a href="#BBM17">386</a>]. There are proposed classical public-key 
cryptosystems not believed to be broken by quantum algorithms, <i>cf.</i> 
[<a href="#BBD09">248</a>]. At the core of Shor's factoring algorithm is 
order finding, which can be reduced to the <a href="#abelian_HSP">Abelian hidden subgroup problem</a>, 
which is solved using the quantum Fourier transform. A number of other 
problems are known to reduce  to integer factorization including the 
membership problem for matrix groups over fields of odd order 
[<a href="#BBS09">253</a>], and certain diophantine problems relevant to 
the synthesis of quantum circuits [<a href="#RS12">254</a>].
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Discrete-log<br /> 
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> We are given three <i>n</i>-bit
numbers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>N</i>, with the promise that 
\( b = a^s \mod N \) for some <i>s</i>. The task is to find <i>s</i>.
As shown by Shor [<a href="#Shor_factoring">82</a>], this can be achieved
on a quantum computer in poly(<i>n</i>) time. The fastest known
classical algorithm requires time superpolynomial in <i>n</i>. By similar
techniques to those in [<a href="#Shor_factoring">82</a>], quantum computers
can solve the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves, thereby breaking
elliptic curve cryptography [<a href="#Zalka_ellip">109</a>, <a href="#BL95">14</a>]. A further optimization to Shor's algorithm is given in [<a href="#E17">385</a>]. The superpolynomial quantum speedup has also been extended to the discrete
logarithm problem on semigroups [<a href="#Childs_Ivanyos">203</a>,
<a href="#Banin_Tsaban">204</a>]. See also <a href="#abelian_HSP">Abelian hidden subgroup</a>.
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Pell's Equation<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Given a positive nonsquare integer <i>d</i>,
Pell's equation is \( x^2 - d y^2 = 1 \). For any such <i>d</i>
there are infinitely many pairs of integers (<i>x,y</i>)
solving this equation. Let \( (x_1,y_1) \) be the pair that minimizes 
\( x+y\sqrt{d} \). If <i>d</i> is an <i>n</i>-bit integer
(<i>i.e.</i> \( 0 \leq d \lt 2^n \) ), \( (x_1,y_1) \)
 may in general require exponentially many bits to write down. Thus it
 is in general impossible to find \( (x_1,y_1) \) in polynomial time. 
 Let \( R = \log(x_1+y_1 \sqrt{d}) \). \( \lfloor R \rceil \)
 uniquely identifies \( (x_1,y_1) \). As shown by Hallgren 
[<a href="#Hallgren_Pell">49</a>], given a <i>n</i>-bit number 
<i>d</i>, a quantum computer can find \( \lfloor R \rceil \)
 in poly(<i>n</i>) time. No polynomial time classical algorithm for
 this problem is known. Factoring reduces to this problem. This
 algorithm breaks the Buchman-Williams cryptosystem. See also <a href="#abelian_HSP">Abelian
 hidden subgroup</a>.
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Principal Ideal <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> We are given an <i>n</i>-bit integer <i>d</i> and an
 invertible ideal <i>I</i>  of the ring \( \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}] \). 
 <i>I</i> is a principal ideal if there exists \( \alpha \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d}) \)
 such that \( I = \alpha \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}] \). \( \alpha \) may be exponentially
 large in <i>d</i>. Therefore \( \alpha \) cannot in general even be written down
 in polynomial time. However, \( \lfloor \log \alpha \rceil \)
 uniquely identifies \( \alpha \). The task is to determine whether <i>I</i>
 is principal and if so find \( \lfloor \log \alpha \rceil \).
 As shown by Hallgren, this can be done in polynomial time on a quantum computer
 [<a href="#Hallgren_Pell">49</a>]. A modified quantum algorithm for this problem
 using fewer qubits was given in [<a href="#Schmidt_PIP">131</a>]. A quantum
 algorithm solving the principal ideal problem in number fields of arbitrary degree
 (<i>i.e.</i> scaling polynomially in the degree) was subsequently given in 
 [<a href="#Biasse_Song16">329</a>]. Factoring reduces to solving Pell's equation,
 which reduces to the principal ideal problem. Thus the principal ideal problem
 is at least as hard as factoring  and therefore is probably not in P. See also
 <a href="#abelian_HSP">Abelian hidden subgroup</a>.
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Unit Group <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> The number field \( \mathbb{Q}(\theta) \)
 is said to be of degree <i>d</i> if the lowest degree polynomial of which 
 \( \theta \) is a root has degree <i>d</i>. The set \( \mathcal{O} \)
 of elements of \( \mathbb{Q}(\theta) \) which are roots of monic polynomials in
 \( \mathbb{Z}[x] \) forms a ring, called the ring of integers of 
 \( \mathbb{Q}(\theta) \). The set of units (invertible elements) of the ring 
 \( \mathcal{O} \) form a group denoted \( \mathcal{O}^* \). As shown by
 Hallgren [<a href="#Hallgren_unit">50</a>], and independently by Schmidt and 
 Vollmer [<a href="#Schmidt">116</a>], for any \( \mathbb{Q}(\theta) \)
 of fixed degree, a quantum computer can find in polynomial time a set
 of generators for \( \mathcal{O}^* \) given a description of \( \theta \).
 No polynomial time classical algorithm for this problem is known. Hallgren
 and collaborators subsequently discovered how to achieve polynomial scaling
 in the degree [<a href="#EHKS14">213</a>]. See also [<a href="#Biasse_Song16">329</a>].
 The algorithms rely on solving Abelian hidden subgroup problems over the additive
 group of real numbers.
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Class Group <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> 
 The number field \( \mathbb{Q}(\theta) \)
 is said to be of degree <i>d</i> if the lowest degree polynomial of which 
 \( \theta \) is a root has degree <i>d</i>. The set \( \mathcal{O} \)
 of elements of \( \mathbb{Q}(\theta) \) which are roots of monic polynomials in
 \( \mathbb{Z}[x] \) forms a ring, called the ring of integers of 
 \( \mathbb{Q}(\theta) \), which is a Dedekind domain. For a Dedekind domain, the nonzero
 fractional ideals modulo the nonzero principal ideals form a group called the class group.
 As shown by Hallgren [<a href="#Hallgren_unit">50</a>], a quantum computer can find
 a set of generators for the class group of the ring of
 integers of any constant degree number field, given a description of \( \theta \), in time
 poly(log(\( | \mathcal{O} | \))). An improved quantum algorithm, whose runtime is also
 polynomial in <i>d</i> was subsequently given in [<a href="#Biasse_Song16">329</a>].
 No polynomial time classical algorithm for these problems are known. See also <a href="#abelian_HSP">Abelian
 hidden subgroup</a>. 
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Gauss Sums <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Let \( \mathbb{F}_q \) be a finite field. The elements other
 than zero of \( \mathbb{F}_q \) form a group \( \mathbb{F}_q^\times \) under
 multiplication, and the elements of \( \mathbb{F}_q \) form an (Abelian but 
 not necessarily cyclic) group \( \mathbb{F}_q^+ \) under addition. We can choose 
 some character \(  \chi^\times \) of \( \mathbb{F}_q^\times \) and some 
 character \( \chi^+ \) of \( \mathbb{F}_q^+ \). The corresponding Gauss sum
 is the inner product of these characters: 
 \( \sum_{x \neq 0 \in \mathbb{F}_q} \chi^+(x) \chi^\times(x) \)
 As shown by van Dam and Seroussi [<a href="#vanDam_Gauss">90</a>], Gauss sums
 can be estimated to polynomial precision on a quantum computer in polynomial
 time. Although a finite ring does not form a group under
 multiplication, its set of units does. Choosing a representation for
 the additive group of the ring, and choosing a representation for the
 multiplicative group of its units, one can obtain a Gauss sum over
 the units of a finite ring. These can also be estimated to polynomial
 precision on a quantum computer in polynomial 
 time [<a href="#vanDam_Gauss">90</a>]. No polynomial time
 classical algorithm for estimating Gauss sums is known. Discrete log
 reduces to Gauss sum estimation [<a href="#vanDam_Gauss">90</a>]. Certain partition
 functions of  the Potts model can be computed by a polynomial-time quantum  algorithm
 related to Gauss sum estimation [<a href="#Geraci_exact">47</a>].
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b>Primality Proving<br />
<b>Speedup:</b>Polynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> Given an <i>n</i>-bit number, return a proof of its primality. The fastest classical
algorithms are AKS, the best versions of which [<a href="#AKS1">393</a>, <a href="#AKS2">394</a>] have
essentially-quartic complexity, and ECPP, where the heuristic complexity of the fastest version
[<a href="#ECPP">395</a>] is also essentially quartic. The fastest known quantum algorithm for this
problem is the method of Donis-Vela and Garcia-Escartin [<a href="#DVGE">396</a>], with complexity
\( O(n^2 (\log \ n)^3 \log \ \log \ n) \). This improves upon a prior factoring-based quantum algorithm
for primality proving [<a href="#ChauLo">397</a>] that has complexity \( O(n^3 \log \ n \ \log \ \log \ n) \).
A recent result of Harvey and Van Der Hoeven [<a href="#HVDH">398</a>] can be used to improve the
complexity of the factoring-based quantum algorithm for primality proving to \( O(n^3 \log n) \)
and it may be possible to similarly reduce the complexity of the Donis-Vela-Garcia-Escartin algorithm
to \( O(n^2 (\log \ n)^3) \) [<a href="#Greathouse">399</a>].
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b>Solving Exponential Congruences<br />
<b>Speedup:</b>Polynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b>
 We are given \( a,b,c,f,g \in \mathbb{F}_q \). We must find integers \(x,y\)
 such that \( a f^x + b g^y = c \). As shown in [<a href="#VDS08">111</a>],
 quantum computers can solve this problem in \( \widetilde{O}(q^{3/8}) \) time whereas the best
 classical algorithm requires \( \widetilde{O}(q^{9/8}) \) time. The quantum algorithm of 
 [<a href="#VDS08">111</a>] is based on the quantum algorithms for discrete logarithms 
 and searching.
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Matrix Elements of Group Representations<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> All representations of finite groups and compact linear
groups can be expressed as unitary matrices given an appropriate choice of
basis. Conjugating the regular representation of a group by the
quantum Fourier transform circuit over that group yields a direct sum
of the group's irreducible representations. Thus, the efficient
quantum Fourier transform over the symmetric
group [<a href="#Beals_general">196</a>], together with the Hadamard
test, yields a fast quantum algorithm for additively approximating
individual matrix elements of the arbitrary irreducible 
representations of \( S_n \). Similarly, using the quantum Schur
transform [<a href="#Schur">197</a>], one can efficiently approximate matrix elements of
the irreducible representations of SU(n) that have polynomial weight.
Direct implementations of individual irreducible representations for
the groups U(n), SU(n), SO(n), and \( A_n \) by efficient quantum
circuits are given in [<a href="#SPJ08">106</a>]. Instances that appear
to be exponentially hard for known classical algorithms are also
identified in [<a href="#SPJ08">106</a>].<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Verifying Matrix Products <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Given three \( n \times n \) matrices, <i>A,B</i>, and <i>C</i>,
 the matrix product verification problem is to decide whether <i>AB=C</i>.
 Classically, the best known algorithm achieves this in time \( O(n^2) \),
 whereas the best known classical algorithm for matrix multiplication runs in time 
 \( O(n^{2.373}) \). Ambainis <i>et al.</i> discovered a quantum algorithm for this
 problem with runtime \( O(n^{7/4}) \) [<a href="#Ambainis_matrix">6</a>]. Subsequently,
 Buhrman and &#352;palek improved upon this, obtaining a quantum algorithm for this
 problem with runtime \( O(n^{5/3}) \) [<a  href="#Buhrman_matrix">19</a>]. This latter 
 algorithm is based on results regarding quantum walks that were proven in 
 [<a href="#Szegedy">85</a>]. 
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Subset-sum <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Given a list of integers \( x_1,\ldots,x_n \), and
a target integer <i>s</i>, the subset-sum problem is to determine
whether the sum of any subset of the given integers adds up
to <i>s</i>. This problem is NP-complete, and therefore is unlikely to
be solvable by classical or quantum algorithms with polynomial
worst-case complexity. In the hard instances the given integers
are of order \( 2^n \) and much research on subset sum focuses on
average case instances in this regime. In [<a href="#BJLM13">178</a>], a quantum
algorithm is given that solves such instances in time \( 2^{0.241n} \),
up to polynomial factors. This quantum algorithm works by applying a
variant of Ambainis's quantum walk algorithm for 
element-distinctness [<a href="#Ambainis_distinctness">7</a>] to speed up a sophisticated
classical algorithm for this problem due to Howgrave-Graham and
Joux. The fastest known classical algorithm for such instances of subset-sum runs in time
\( 2^{0.291n} \), up to polynomial factors [<a href="#BCJ11">404</a>].<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Decoding <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Varies <br />
<b>Description:</b> Classical error correcting codes allow the
detection and correction of bit-flips by storing data
reduntantly. Maximum-likelihood decoding for arbitrary linear codes is
NP-complete in the worst case, but for structured codes or bounded
error efficient decoding algorithms are known. Quantum algorithms have
been formulated to speed up the decoding of convolutional codes
[<a href="#GM14">238</a>] and simplex codes
[<a href="#BZ98">239</a>].<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Quantum Cryptanalysis <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Various <br />
<b>Description:</b> It is well-known that Shor's algorithms for
factoring and discrete logarithms
[<a href="#Shor_factoring">82</a>,<a href="#Shor_factoring94">125</a>]
completely break the RSA and Diffie-Hellman cryptosystems, as well as
their elliptic-curve-based variants [<a href="#Zalka_ellip">109</a>, <a href="#BL95">14</a>]. 
(A number of "post-quantum" public-key cryptosystems have been proposed to replace these
primitives, which are not known to be broken by quantum attacks.)
Beyond Shor's algorithm, there is a growing body of work on quantum
algorithms specifically designed to attack cryptosystems. These
generally fall into three categories. The first is quantum algorithms
providing polynomial or sub-exponential time attacks on cryptosystems
under standard assumptions. In particular, the algorithm of Childs,
Jao, and Soukharev for finding isogenies of elliptic curves breaks
certain elliptic curve based cryptosystems in subexponential time
that were not already broken by Shor's algorithm
[<a href="#CJS14">283</a>]. The second category is quantum algorithms
achieving polynomial improvement over known classical cryptanalytic
attacks by speeding up parts of these classical algorithms using
Grover search, quantum collision finding, etc. Such attacks 
on private-key [<a href="#GLRS15">284</a>, <a href="#AMGMPS16">285</a>, <a href="#K14">288</a>, <a href="#BHT98b">315</a>, <a href="#B09">316</a>] 
and public-key [<a href="#LMP13">262</a>, <a href="#F15">287</a>] primitives, do not
preclude the use of the associated cryptosystems but may influence
choice of key size. The third category is attacks that make use of quantum 
superposition queries to block ciphers. These attacks in many cases completely
break the cryptographic primitives [<a href="#KLLNP16">286</a>, <a href="#KM10">289</a>, 
<a href="#KM12">290</a>, <a href="#RS13">291</a>, <a href="#SS16">292</a>].
However, in most practical situations such superposition queries are 
unlikely to be feasible.

<h2>Oracular Algorithms</h2>

<b>Algorithm:</b> Searching <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> We are given an oracle with <i>N</i>
 allowed inputs. For one input <i>w</i> ("the winner") the corresponding output is
 1, and for all other inputs the corresponding output is 0. The task is to find 
 <i>w</i>. On a classical computer this requires \(  \Omega(N) \)
 queries. The quantum algorithm of Lov Grover achieves this using
 \( O(\sqrt{N}) \) queries [<a href="#Grover_search">48</a>], which is
 optimal [<a href="#BBBV">216</a>]. This has algorithm has
 subsequently been generalized to search in the presence of multiple
 "winners" [<a href="#BBHT98">15</a>], evaluate the sum of an arbitrary
 function [<a href="#BBHT98">15</a>,<a href="#BHT98">16</a>,<a href="#Mos98">73</a>],
 find the global minimum of an arbitrary function 
 [<a href="#DH96">35</a>,<a href="#NW99">75</a>, <a href="#KLPF08">255</a>], take advantage of alternative
 initial states [<a href="#Biham">100</a>] or nonuniform probabilistic priors
 [<a href="#Montanaro">123</a>], work with oracles whose runtime varies 
 between inputs [<a href="#Ambainis_linear">138</a>], approximate 
 definite integrals [<a href="#integration">77</a>], and converge to a
 fixed-point
 [<a href="#G05">208</a>, <a href="#TGP05">209</a>]. Considerations on optimizing
 the depth of quantum search circuits are given in [<a href="#ZK19">405</a>]. The
 generalization of Grover's algorithm known as amplitude estimation
 [<a href="#Amplitude">17</a>]
 is now an important primitive in quantum algorithms. Amplitude estimation forms the
 core of most known quantum algorithms related to collision finding and graph 
 properties. One of the natural applications for Grover search is speeding up the 
 solution to NP-complete problems such as 3-SAT. Doing so is nontrivial, because 
 the best classical algorithm for 3-SAT is not quite a brute force search. Nevertheless,
 amplitude amplification enables a quadratic quantum speedup over the best
 classical 3-SAT algorithm, as shown in [<a href="#Ambainis_SIGACT">133</a>]. Quadratic
 speedups for other constraint satisfaction problems are obtained in 
 [<a href="#CGF">134</a>]. For further examples of application of
 Grover search and amplitude amplification see
 [<a href="#C14">261</a>, <a href="#LMP13">262</a>]. A problem closely
 related to, but harder than, Grover search, is spatial search, in
 which database queries are limited by some graph structure. On
 sufficiently well-connected graphs, \(O(\sqrt{n})\) quantum query
 complexity is still achievable [<a href="#CG04">274</a>,<a href="#CNAO15">275</a>,<a href="#Wong16">303</a>,
<a href="#JMW14">304</a>, <a href="#MW14">305</a>, <a href="#Wong15">306</a>, <a href="#HK16">330</a>].

<a name="abelian_HSP"></a>
<b>Algorithm:</b> Abelian Hidden Subgroup <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Let <i>G</i> be a finitely generated Abelian group, and let
 <i>H</i> be some subgroup of <i>G</i> such that <i>G/H</i> is finite. Let <i>f</i>
 be a function on <i>G</i> such that for any \( g_1,g_2 \in G \), \( f(g_1) = f(g_2) \)
 if and only if \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are in the same coset of <i>H</i>. The task is
 to find <i>H</i> (<i>i.e.</i> find a set of generators for <i>H</i>) by making queries
 to <i>f</i>. This is solvable on a quantum computer using \( O(\log \vert G\vert) \)
 queries, whereas classically \( \Omega(|G|) \) are required. This algorithm was first
 formulated in full generality by Boneh and Lipton in [<a href="#BL95">14</a>]. However,
 proper attribution of this algorithm is difficult because, as described in chapter 5 of 
 [<a href="#Nielsen_Chuang">76</a>], it subsumes many historically important quantum
 algorithms as special cases, including Simon's algorithm [<a href="#Simon">108</a>], 
 which was the inspiration for Shor's period finding algorithm, which forms the core 
 of his factoring and discrete-log algorithms. The Abelian hidden subgroup algorithm 
 is also at the core of the Pell's equation, principal ideal, unit group, and class 
 group algorithms. In certain instances, the Abelian hidden subgroup problem can be
 solved using a single query rather than order \( \log(\vert G\vert) \), as shown
 in [<a href="#Beaudrap">30</a>]. It is normally assumed in period finding that the
 function \(f(x) \neq f(y) \) unless \( x-y = s \), where \( s \) is the period.
 A quantum algorithm which applies even when this restiction is relaxed is given in 
 [<a href="#Hales_Hallgren">388</a>]. Period finding has been generalized to apply to 
 oracles which provide only the few most significant bits about the underlying 
 function in [<a href="#SW07">389</a>].
<br /><br />

<a name="nonabelian_HSP"></a>
<b>Algorithm:</b> Non-Abelian Hidden Subgroup <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Let <i>G</i> be a finitely generated group, and let <i>H</i> be
 some subgroup of <i>G</i> that has finitely many left cosets. Let <i>f</i> be a 
 function on <i>G</i> such that for any \( g_1, g_2 \), \( f(g_1) = f(g_2) \)
 if and only if \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are in the same left coset of <i>H</i>.
 The task is to find <i>H</i> (<i>i.e.</i> find a set of generators for <i>H</i>)
 by making queries to <i>f</i>. This is solvable on a quantum computer using 
 \( O(\log(|G|) \) queries, whereas classically \( \Omega(|G|) \)
 are required [<a href="#Ettinger">37</a>,<a href="#Hallgren_Russell">51</a>].
 However, this does not qualify as an efficient quantum algorithm because in general,
 it may take exponential time to process the quantum states obtained from these 
 queries. Efficient quantum algorithms for the hidden subgroup problem are known for
 certain specific non-Abelian groups 
[<a href="#RB_NAHS">81</a>,<a href="#IMS_NAHS">55</a>,<a href="#MRRS_NAHS">72</a>,<a href="#IlG_NAHS">53</a>,<a href="#BCvD_NAHS">9</a>,<a href="#CKL_NAHS">22</a>,<a href="#ISS_NAHS">56</a>,<a href="#CP_NAHS">71</a>,<a href="#ISS2_NAHS">57</a>,<a href="#FIMSS_NAHS">43</a>,<a href="#G_NAHS">44</a>,<a href="#CvD_NAHS">28</a>,<a href="#DMR_NAHS">126</a>,<a href="#W_NAHS">207</a>,<a href="#NAHS_BVZ">273</a>]. 
 A slightly outdated survey is given in [<a href="#Survey_NAHS">69</a>]. Of 
 particular interest are the symmetric group and the dihedral group. A solution 
 for the symmetric group would solve graph isomorphism. A solution for the 
 dihedral group would solve certain lattice problems [<a href="#Regev_lattice">78</a>].
 Despite much effort, no polynomial-time solution for these groups is known, except in
 special cases [<a href="#Roet16">312</a>]. However, 
 Kuperberg [<a href="#Kuperberg">66</a>] found a time \( 2^{O( \sqrt{\log N})}) \)
 algorithm for finding a hidden subgroup of the dihedral group \( D_N \). Regev 
 subsequently improved this algorithm so that it uses not only subexponential time 
 but also polynomial space [<a href="#Regev_dihedral">79</a>]. A
 further improvement in the asymptotic scaling of the required number
 of qubits is obtained in [<a href="#K13">218</a>]. Quantum query speedups (though
 not necessarily efficient quantum algorithms in terms of gate count) for
 somewhat more general problems of testing for isomorphisms of functions under sets of 
 permutations are given in [<a href="#HM16">311</a>]
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Bernstein-Vazirani <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial Directly, Superpolynomial Recursively <br />
<b>Description:</b> We are given an oracle whose input is <i>n</i>
 bits and whose output is one bit. Given input \( x \in \{0,1\}^n \), the output is 
 \( x \odot h \), where <i>h</i> is the "hidden" string of <i>n</i> bits, and 
 \( \odot \) denotes the bitwise inner product modulo 2. The task is to find <i>h</i>.
 On a classical computer this requires <i>n</i> queries. As shown by Bernstein and 
 Vazirani [<a href="#Bernstein_Vazirani">11</a>], this can be achieved on a quantum 
 computer using a single query. Furthermore, one can construct recursive versions of
 this problem, called recursive Fourier sampling, such that quantum computers require
 exponentially fewer queries than classical computers 
 [<a href="#Bernstein_Vazirani">11</a>]. See 
 [<a href="#HH08">256</a>, <a href="#BH10">257</a>] for related work
on the ubiquity of quantum speedups from generic quantum circuits and
[<a href="#AA14">258</a>, <a href="#ABK15">270</a>] for related work on a quantum query speedup
for detecting correlations between the an oracle function and the
Fourier transform of another.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Deutsch-Jozsa <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Exponential over P, none over BPP<br />
<b>Description:</b> We are given an oracle whose input is <i>n</i> bits and whose output
 is one bit. We are promised that out of the \( 2^n \) possible inputs, either all of them,
 none of them, or half of them yield output 1. The task is to distinguish the balanced case
 (half of all inputs yield output 1) from the constant case (all or none of the inputs yield
 output 1). It was shown by Deutsch [<a href="#Deutsch">32</a>] that for <i>n=1</i>, this
 can be solved on a quantum computer using one query, whereas any deterministic classical 
 algorithm requires two. This was historically the first well-defined quantum algorithm 
 achieving a speedup over classical computation. (A related, more recent, pedagogical 
 example is given in [<a href="#G14">259</a>].) A single-query quantum algorithm for 
 arbitrary <i>n</i> was developed by Deutsch and Jozsa in [<a href="#Deutsch_Jozsa">33</a>].
 Although probabilistically easy to solve with <i>O(1)</i> queries, the Deutsch-Jozsa problem
 has exponential worst case deterministic query complexity classically.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Formula Evaluation <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> A Boolean expression is called a formula if each variable is used only
 once. A formula corresponds to a circuit with no fanout, which consequently has the topology
 of a tree. By Reichardt's span-program formalism, it is now known 
 [<a href="#Reichardt_Reflection">158</a>] that the quantum query complexity of any formula
 of <i>O</i>(1) fanin on <i>N</i> variables is \( \Theta(\sqrt{N}) \).
 This result culminates from a long line of work
 [<a href="#Childs_Jordan">27</a>,<a href="#ragged">8</a>,<a href="#Reichardt_Spalek">80</a>,<a href="#Reichardt_Unbalanced">159</a>,<a href="#Reichardt_Faster">160</a>], 
 which started with the discovery by Farhi <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#Farhi_NAND">38</a>]
 that NAND trees on \( 2^n \) variables can be evaluated on quantum computers in time
 \( O(2^{0.5n}) \) using a continuous-time quantum walk, whereas classical computers
 require \( \Omega(2^{0.753n}) \) queries. In many cases, the quantum formula-evaluation 
 algorithms are efficient not only in query complexity but also in time-complexity. The 
 span-program formalism also yields quantum query complexity lower bounds
 [<a href="#Reichardt2010">149</a>]. Although originally discovered from a different point of 
 view, Grover's algorithm can be regarded as a special case of formula evaluation in which 
 every gate is OR. The quantum complexity of evaluating non-boolean formulas has also been
 studied [<a href="#Cleve_tree">29</a>], but is not as fully understood. Childs <i>et al.</i> 
 have generalized to the case in which input variables may be repeated (<i>i.e.</i> the first 
 layer of the circuit may include fanout) [<a href="#Childs_Kimmel_Kothari">101</a>]. They 
 obtained a quantum algorithm using \( O(\min \{N,\sqrt{S},N^{1/2} G^{1/4} \}) \)
 queries, where <i>N</i> is the number of input variables not including multiplicities,
 <i>S</i> is the number of inputs counting multiplicities, and <i>G</i> is the number of
 gates in the formula. References [<a href="#Zhan_Kimmel_Hassidim">164</a>],
 [<a href="#Kimmel">165</a>], and  [<a href="#JK15">269</a>] consider
 special cases of the NAND tree problem in which the  number of NAND
 gates taking unequal inputs is limited. Some of these cases yield
 superpolynomial separation between quantum and classical query
 complexity.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Hidden Shift <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> We are given oracle access to some function <i>f</i> on 
 \( \mathbb{Z}_N \). We know that <i>f(x) = g(x+s)</i> where <i>g</i> is a known function 
 and <i>s</i> is an unknown shift. The hidden shift problem is to find <i>s</i>. By
 reduction from Grover's problem it is clear that at least \( \sqrt{N} \) queries
 are necessary to solve hidden shift in general. However, certain special cases of the
 hidden shift problem are solvable on quantum computers using <i>O(1)</i> queries. In 
 particular, van Dam <i>et al.</i> showed that this can be done if <i>f</i> is a multiplicative
 character of a finite ring or field [<a href="#vanDam_shift">89</a>]. The previously 
 discovered shifted Legendre symbol algorithm 
 [<a href="#vanDam_Legendre">88</a>,<a href="#vanDam_weighing">86</a>] is subsumed as a
 special case of this, because the Legendre symbol  \( \left(\frac{x}{p} \right) \)
 is a multiplicative character of \( \mathbb{F}_p \).  No classical algorithm running in time
 <i>O</i>(polylog(<i>N</i>)) is known for these problems. Furthermore, the quantum algorithm
 for the shifted Legendre symbol problem would break a certain
 cryptographic pseudorandom generator given the ability to make
 quantum queries to the generator [<a href="#vanDam_shift">89</a>].
 A quantum speedup for hidden shift problems of difference sets is given in [<a href="#Roet16">312</a>],
 and this also subsumes the Legendre symbol problem as a special case.
 Roetteler has found exponential quantum speedups for 
 finding hidden shifts of certain nonlinear Boolean functions
 [<a href="#Roetteler08">105</a>,<a href="#Roetteler_quad">130</a>]. Building on this work,
 Gavinsky, Roetteler, and Roland have shown [<a href="#Gavinsky">142</a>] that the hidden 
 shift problem on random boolean functions \( f:\mathbb{Z}_2^n \to \mathbb{Z}_2 \)
 has <i>O(n)</i> average case quantum complexity, whereas the classical query
 complexity is \( \Omega(2^{n/2}) \). The results in [<a href="#Ettinger_Hoyer">143</a>],
 though they are phrased in terms of the hidden subgroup problem for the dihedral group, imply
 that the quantum <i>query</i> complexity of the hidden shift problem for an injective function
 on \( \mathbb{Z}_N \) is <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>), whereas the classical query complexity is 
 \( \Theta(\sqrt{N}) \). However, the best known quantum <i>circuit</i> complexity for injective
 hidden shift on \( \mathbb{Z}_N \) is \( O(2^{C \sqrt{\log N}}) \), achieved by Kuperberg's
 sieve algorithm [<a href="#Kuperberg">66</a>]. A recent result, building upon [<a href="#Ivanyos08">408</a>, <a href="#FIMSS_NAHS">43</a>],
 achieves exponential quantum speedups for some generalizations of the Hidden shift problem including
 the <i>hidden multiple shift problem</i>, in which one has query access to \(f_s(x) = f(x-hs) \)
 over some allowed range of <i>s</i> and one wishes to infer <i>h</i> [<a href="#IPS18">407</a>].
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Polynomial interpolation <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Varies <br />
<b>Description:</b> Let \( p(x) = a_d x^d + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0 \) be a polynomial over the finite field \( \mathrm{GF}(q) \). One is given access to an oracle that, given \( x \in \mathrm{GF}(q) \), returns \( p(x) \). The polynomial reconstruction problem is, by making queries to the oracle, to determine the coefficients \( a_d,\ldots,a_0 \). Classically, \( d + 1 \) queries are necessary and sufficient. (In some sources use the term reconstruction instead of interpolation for this problem.) Quantumly, \( d/2 + 1/2 \) queries are necessary and \( d/2 + 1 \) queries are sufficient [<a href="#interp1">360</a>,<a href="#interp2">361</a>]. For multivariate polynomials of degree <i>d</i> in <i>n</i> variables the interpolation problem has classical query complexity \( \binom{n+d}{d} \). As shown in [<a href="#interp3">387</a>], the quantum query complexity is \( O \left( \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{n+d}{d} \right) \) over \( \mathbb{R} \) and \( \mathbb{C} \) and it is \( O \left( \frac{d}{n+d} \binom{n+d}{d} \right) \) over \( \mathbb{F}_q \) for sufficiently large <i>q</i>. Quantum algorithms have also been discovered for the case that the oracle returns \( \chi(f(x)) \) where \( \chi \) is a quadratic character of \( \mathrm{GF}(q) \) [<a href="#RS04">390</a>], and the case where the oracle returns \( f(x)^e \) [<a href="#IKS17">392</a>]. These generalize the hidden shift algorithm of [<a href="#vanDam_shift">89</a>] and achieve an exponential speedup over classical computation. A quantum algorithm for reconstructing rational functions over finite fields given noisy and incomplete oracle access to the function values is given in [<a href="#HRS05">391</a>].
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Pattern matching <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Given strings <i>T</i> of length <i>n</i>
and <i>P</i> of length <i>m</i> &lt; <i>n</i>, both from some finite
alphabet, the pattern matching problem is to find an occurrence
of <i>P</i> as a substring of <i>T</i> or to report that <i>P</i> is
not a substring of <i>T</i>. More generally, <i>T</i> and <i>P</i>
could be <i>d</i>-dimensional arrays rather than one-dimensional
arrays (strings). Then, the pattern matching problem is to return the
location of <i>P</i> as a   \(m \times m \times \ldots \times m\)
block within the \(n \times n \times \ldots \times n\) array <i>T</i>
or report that no such location exists. The \( \Omega(\sqrt{N}) \)
query lower bound for unstructured search [<a href="#BBBV">216</a>]
implies that the worst-case quantum query complexity of this problem
is \( \Omega ( \sqrt{n} + \sqrt{m} ) \). A quantum algorithm achieving
this, up to logarithmic factors, was obtained in
[<a href="#RV00">217</a>]. This quantum algorithm works through the
use of Grover's algorithm together with a classical method called
deterministic sampling. More recently, Montanaro showed that
superpolynomial quantum speedup can be achieved on average case
instances of pattern matching, provided that <i>m</i> is greater than
logarithmic in <i>n</i>. Specifically, the quantum algorithm  given in
[<a href="#Montanaro14">215</a>] solves average case pattern matching in 
\( \widetilde{O}((n/m)^{d/2} 2^{O(d^{3/2} \sqrt{\log m})})\) time. This
quantum algorithm is constructed by generalizing Kuperberg's quantum
sieve algorithm [<a href="#Kuperberg">66</a>] for dihedral hidden subgroup and
hidden shift problems so that it can operate in <i>d</i> dimensions
and accomodate small amounts of noise, and then classically reducing the
pattern matching problem to this noisy <i>d</i>-dimensional version of
hidden shift.
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Ordered Search <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Constant factor <br />
<b>Description:</b> We are given oracle access to a list of <i>N</i> numbers in order 
 from least to greatest. Given a number <i>x</i>, the task is to find out where in the 
 list it would fit. Classically, the best possible algorithm is binary search which takes
 \( \log_2 N \) queries. Farhi <i>et al.</i> showed that a quantum computer can achieve 
 this using 0.53 \( \log_2 N \) queries [<a href="#FGGS99">39</a>]. Currently, the best 
 known deterministic quantum algorithm for this problem uses 0.433 \( \log_2 N \)
 queries [<a href="#Landahl">103</a>]. A lower bound of \( \frac{\ln 2}{\pi} \log_2 N \)
 quantum queries has been proven for this problem
 [<a href="#HNS01">219</a>, <a href="#Childs_Lee">24</a>]. In
 [<a href="#Ben_Or_Search">10</a>], a randomized quantum algorithm is given whose expected
 query complexity is less than \( \frac{1}{3} \log_2 N \).
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Graph Properties in the Adjacency Matrix Model<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Let <i>G</i> be a graph of <i>n</i> vertices. We are given access to
 an oracle, which given a pair of integers in {1,2,...,<i>n</i>} tells us whether the
 corresponding vertices are connected by an edge. Building on previous work 
 [<a href="#DH96">35</a>,<a href="#prev2">52</a>,<a href="#prev3">36</a>], D&uuml;rr 
 <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#Durr_graphs">34</a>] show that the quantum query complexity 
 of finding a minimum spanning tree of weighted graphs, and deciding connectivity for 
 directed and undirected graphs have \( \Theta(n^{3/2}) \) quantum query complexity,
 and that finding lowest weight paths has \( O(n^{3/2}\log^2 n) \) quantum query complexity. Deciding whether a graph is bipartite, detecting cycles, and deciding whether a given vertex can be reached from another (st-connectivity) can all be achieved using a number of queries and quantum gates that both scale as \( \widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}) \), and only logarithmically many qubits, as shown in [<a href="#CMB16">317</a>], building upon [<a href="#Berzina">13</a>, <a href="#Arins">272</a>, <a href="#BR12">318</a>]. A span-program-based quantum algorithm for detecting trees of a given
 size as minors in \( \widetilde{O}(n) \) time is given in
 [<a href="#Wang13">240</a>]. A graph property is 
 sparse if there exists a constant <i>c</i> such that every graph with the property has
 a ratio of edges to vertices at most <i>c</i>. Childs and Kothari have shown that all 
 sparse graph properties have query complexity \( \Theta(n^{2/3}) \) if they cannot be
 characterized by a list of forbidden subgraphs and \( o(n^{2/3}) \) 
 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Little-o_notation">little-o</a>)
 if they can [<a href="#Childs_minor">140</a>]. The former algorithm is based on Grover 
 search, the latter on the quantum walk formalism of [<a href="#Magniez_walk">141</a>].
 By Mader's theorem, sparse graph properties include all nontrivial minor-closed properties.
 These include planarity, being a forest, and not containing a path of
 given length. According to the widely-believed Aanderaa-Karp-Rosenberg conjecture, all of the above problems have \( \Omega(n^2) \) classical query complexity. Another
 interesting computational problem is finding a subgraph <i>H</i> in a given graph <i>G</i>.
 The simplest case of this finding the triangle, that is, the clique of size three. The
 fastest known quantum algorithm for this finds a triangle in \( O(n^{5/4}) \)
 quantum queries [<a href="#CLM16">319</a>], improving upon
 [<a href="#LG14">276</a>, <a href="#Lee_Magniez_Santha12">175</a>, <a href="#Jeffery_Kothari_Magniez12">171</a>, 
  <a href="#Magniez_triangle">70</a>, <a href="#Belovs_Constant">152</a>, 
  <a href="#Buhrman_collision">21</a>]. Stronger quantum query complexity upper bounds are known when the graphs are sufficiently sparse [<a href="#CLM16">319</a>, <a href="#LS15">320</a>]. Classically, triangle finding 
 requires \( \Omega(n^2) \) queries [<a href="#Buhrman_collision">21</a>]. 
 More generally, a quantum computer can find an  
 arbitrary subgraph of <i>k</i> vertices using \( O(n^{2-2/k-t}) \) queries where 
 \( t=(2k-d-3)/(k(d+1)(m+2)) \) and <i>d</i> and <i>m</i> are such that <i>H</i> has
 a vertex of degree <i>d</i> and <i>m</i>+<i>d</i> edges 
 [<a href="#Lee_Magniez_Santha">153</a>]. This improves on the previous algorithm of
 [<a href="#Magniez_triangle">70</a>]. In some cases, this query complexity is beaten by
 the quantum algorithm of [<a href="#Childs_minor">140</a>], which finds <i>H</i>
 using \( \widetilde{O}\left( n^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{\mathrm{vc}(H)+1}} \right) \)
 queries, provided <i>G</i> is sparse, where vc(<i>H</i>) is the size of the minimal 
 vertex cover of <i>H</i>. A quantum algorithm for finding
 constant-sized sub-hypergraphs over 3-uniform hypergraphs in \(
 O(n^{1.883}) \) queries is given in [<a href="#LGNT13">241</a>].
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Graph Properties in the Adjacency List Model<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Let <i>G</i> be a graph of <i>N</i> vertices, <i>M</i> edges, and 
 degree <i>d</i>. We are given access to an oracle which, when queried with the label
 of a vertex and \( j \in \{1,2,\ldots,d\} \) outputs the <i>j</i>th neighbor of the
 vertex or null if the vertex has degree less than <i>d</i>. Suppose we are given the
 promise that <i>G</i> is either bipartite or is far from bipartite in the sense that
 a constant fraction of the edges would need to be removed to achieve bipartiteness. Then,
 as shown in [<a href="#Ambainis_Childs_Liu">144</a>], the quantum complexity of deciding
 bipartiteness is \( \widetilde{O}(N^{1/3}) \). Also in [<a href="#Ambainis_Childs_Liu">144</a>],
 it is shown that distinguishing expander graphs from graphs that are far from
 being expanders has quantum complexity \( \widetilde{O}(N^{1/3}) \) and 
 \( \widetilde{\Omega}(N^{1/4}) \), whereas the classical complexity is 
 \( \widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{N}) \). The key quantum algorithmic tool is Ambainis' algorithm for
 element distinctness. In [<a href="#Durr_graphs">34</a>], it is shown that finding a minimal
 spanning tree has quantum query complexity \( \Theta(\sqrt{NM}) \), deciding graph 
 connectivity has quantum query complexity \( \Theta(N) \) in the undirected case, and
 \( \widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{NM}) \) in the directed case, and computing the lowest weight
 path from a given source to all other vertices on a weighted graph has quantum
 query complexity \( \widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{NM}) \). In [<a href="#CMB16">317</a>] quantum algorithms are given for st-connectivity, deciding bipartiteness, and deciding whether a graph is a forest, which run in \( \widetilde{O}(N \sqrt{d}) \) time and use only logarithmically many qubits. 
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Welded Tree <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Some computational problems can be phrased in terms of the query 
 complexity of finding one's way through a maze. That is, there is some graph <i>G</i>
 to which one is given oracle access. When queried with the label of a given node,
 the oracle returns a list of the labels of all adjacent nodes. The task is, starting
 from some source node (<i>i.e.</i> its label), to find the label of a certain marked
 destination node. As shown by Childs <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#Childs_weld">26</a>], 
 quantum computers can exponentially outperform classical computers at this task for
 at least some graphs. Specifically, consider the graph obtained by joining together
 two depth-<i>n</i> binary trees by a random "weld" such that all nodes but the two
 roots have degree three. Starting from one root, a quantum computer can find the other 
 root using poly(<i>n</i>) queries, whereas this is provably impossible using classical
 queries. 
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Collision Finding and Element Distinctness<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Suppose we are given oracle access to a two to one
 function <i>f</i> on a domain of size <i>N</i>. The collision problem
 is to find a pair \( x,y \in \{1,2,\ldots,N\} \) such that <i>f(x) = f(y)</i>.
 The classical randomized query complexity of this problem is \( \Theta(\sqrt{N}) \),
 whereas, as shown by Brassard <i>et al.</i>, a quantum computer can achieve this 
 using \(O(N^{1/3}) \) queries [<a href="#Brassard_collision">18</a>]. (See also [<a href="#BHT98b">315</a>].) Removing the
 promise that <i>f</i> is two-to-one yields a problem called element distinctness, which
 has \( \Theta(N) \) classical query complexity. Improving upon
 [<a href="#Buhrman_collision">21</a>], Ambainis gives a quantum algorithm with query 
 complexity of \( O(N^{2/3}) \) for element distinctness, which is
 optimal [<a href="#Ambainis_distinctness">7</a>, <a href="#P17">374</a>]. The problem of
 deciding whether any <i>k</i>-fold collisions exist is
 called <i>k</i>-distinctness. Improving upon
 [<a href="#Ambainis_distinctness">7</a>,<a href="#Belovs_Lee">154</a>],
 the best quantum query complexity for <i>k</i>-distinctness is
 \( O(n^{3/4 - 1/(4(2^k-1))}) \)
 [<a href="#Belovs12">172</a>, <a href="#Childs_Jeffery_Kothari_Magniez13">173</a>]. For <i>k</i>=2,3 this is also the time-complexity, up to logarithmic 
 factors, by  [<a href="#Ambainis_distinctness">7</a>]. For \( k > 3\) the fastest known quantum algorithm has time complexity \( O(n^{(k-1)/k}) \) [<a href="#Jefferythesis">363</a>].
 Given two functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>, on domains of
 size <i>N</i> and <i>M</i>, respectively a claw is a pair <i>x,y</i> such that <i>f(x) =
 g(y)</i>. In the case that <i>N</i>=<i>M</i>, the algorithm of  [<a href="#Ambainis_distinctness">7</a>]
 solves claw-finding in \( O(N^{2/3}) \) queries, improving on the previous \( O(N^{3/4} \log N) \) quantum algorithm
 of [<a href="#Buhrman_collision">21</a>]. Further work gives improved query complexity for various parameter regimes
in which \(N \neq M\) [<a href="#Tani">364</a>, <a href="#IwamaKawachi">365</a>].  More generally, a related problem to
 element distinctness, is, given oracle access to a sequence, to
 estimate the \(k^{\mathrm{th}}\) frequency moment \(F_k = \sum_j n_j^k
 \), where \(n_j\) is the number of times that <i>j</i> occurs in the
 sequence. An approximately quadratic speedup for this problem is
 obtained in [<a href="#M15c">277</a>]. See also <a href="#graph_collision">graph collision</a>.
<br /><br />

<a name="graph_collision"></a>
<b>Algorithm:</b> Graph Collision <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> 
We are given an undirected graph of <i>n</i> vertices and oracle
access to a labelling of the vertices by 1 and 0. The graph collision
problem is, by querying this oracle, to decide whether there exist a
pair of vertices, connected by an edge, both of which are labelled
1. One can embed Grover's unstructured search problem as an instance
of graph collision by choosing the star graph, labelling the center 1,
and labelling the remaining vertices by the database entries. Hence,
this problem has quantum query complexity \( \Omega(\sqrt{n}) \) and
classical query complexity \( \Theta (n) \). In
[<a href="#Magniez_triangle">70</a>], Magniez, Nayak, and Szegedy gave
a \( O(N^{2/3}) \)-query quantum algorithm for graph collision on
general graphs. This remains the best upper bound on quantum query
complexity for this problem on general graphs. However, stronger upper
bounds have been obtained for several special classes of
graphs. Specifically, the quantum query complexity on a
graph <i>G</i> is  \( \widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n} + \sqrt{l}) \) where <i>l</i>
is the number of non-edges in <i>G</i> [<a href="#JKM">161</a>],
\(O(\sqrt{n} \alpha^{1/6}) \) where \(\alpha\) is the size of the
largest independent set of <i>G</i> [<a href="#Belovs12">172</a>],
\(O(\sqrt{n} + \sqrt{\alpha^*})\) where \( \alpha^* \) is the maximum
total degree of any independent set of <i>G</i>
[<a href="#GI12">200</a>], and \(O(\sqrt{n} t^{1/6}) \) where <i>t</i> is
the treewidth of <i>G</i> [<a href="#ABI13">201</a>]. Furthermore, the
quantum query complexity is  \( \widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}) \) with high
probability for random graphs in which the presence or absence of an
edge between each pair of vertices is chosen independently with fixed
probability, (<i>i.e.</i> Erd&#337;s-R&eacute;nyi graphs)
[<a href="#GI12">200</a>]. See [<a href="#ABI13">201</a>] for a
summary of these results as well as new upper bounds for two
additional classes of graph that are too complicated to describe here.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Matrix Commutativity <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> We are given oracle access to <i>k</i> matrices, each of which are
 \( n \times n \). Given integers \( i,j \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\} \), and
 \( x \in \{1,2,\ldots,k\} \) the oracle returns the <i>ij</i> matrix element of the 
 \( x^{\mathrm{th}} \) matrix. The task is to decide whether all of these <i>k</i>
 matrices commute. As shown by Itakura [<a href="#Itakura">54</a>], this can be achieved
 on a quantum computer using \( O(k^{4/5}n^{9/5}) \) queries, whereas classically this
 requires \( \Omega( k n^2 ) \) queries.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Group Commutativity <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> We are given a list of <i>k</i> generators for a group <i>G</i> and
 access to a blackbox implementing group multiplication. By querying this blackbox we 
 wish to determine whether the group is commutative. The best known classical algorithm
 is due to Pak and requires <i>O(k)</i> queries. Magniez and Nayak have shown that the 
 quantum query complexity of this task is \( \widetilde{\Theta}(k^{2/3}) \)
 [<a href="#Magniez_Nayak">139</a>].

<b>Algorithm:</b> Hidden Nonlinear Structures <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Any Abelian group <i>G</i> can be visualized as a lattice. A subgroup
 <i>H</i> of <i>G</i> is a sublattice, and the cosets of <i>H</i> are all the shifts of
 that sublattice. The Abelian hidden subgroup problem is normally solved by obtaining
 superposition over a random coset of the Hidden subgroup, and then taking the Fourier
 transform so as to sample from the dual lattice. Rather than generalizing to
 non-Abelian groups (see <a href="#nonabelian_HSP">non-Abelian hidden subgroup</a>), one can instead generalize to
 the problem of identifying hidden subsets other than lattices. As shown by Childs 
<i>et al.</i> [<a href="#Childs_nonlinear">23</a>] this problem is efficiently solvable
 on quantum computers for certain subsets defined by polynomials, such as spheres. 
 Decker <i>et al.</i> showed how to efficiently solve some related problems in 
 [<a href="#Wocjan_nonlinear">31</a>, <a href="#DHIS13">212</a>].

<b>Algorithm:</b> Center of Radial Function <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b>  We are given an oracle that evaluates a function <i>f</i> from 
 \( \mathbb{R}^d \) to some arbitrary set <i>S</i>, where <i>f</i> is spherically 
 symmetric. We wish to locate the center of symmetry, up to some precision. 
 (For simplicity, let the precision be fixed.) In [<a href="#Liu">110</a>], 
 Liu gives a  quantum algorithm, based on a curvelet transform, that solves 
 this problem using a constant number of quantum queries independent of 
 <i>d</i>. This constitutes a polynomial speedup over the classical lower 
 bound, which is \( \Omega(d) \) queries. The algorithm works when the function
 <i>f</i> fluctuates on sufficiently small scales, <i>e.g.</i>, when the level sets 
 of <i>f</i> are sufficiently thin spherical shells. The quantum algorithm is shown
 to work in an idealized continuous model, and nonrigorous arguments suggest that
 discretization effects should be small.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Group Order and Membership <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Suppose a finite group <i>G</i> is given oracularly in the following way.
 To every element in <i>G</i>, one assigns a corresponding label. Given an ordered pair of
 labels of group elements, the oracle returns the label of their product. There are several
 classically hard problems regarding such groups. One is to find the group's order, given the
 labels of a set of generators. Another task is, given a bitstring, to decide whether it 
 corresponds to a group element. The constructive version of this membership problem requires,
 in the yes case, a decomposition of the given element as a product of group generators. 
 Classically, these problems cannot be solved using polylog(|<i>G</i>|) queries even if 
 <i>G</i> is Abelian. For Abelian groups, quantum computers can solve these problems using
 polylog(|<i>G</i>|) queries by reduction to the Abelian hidden subgroup problem, as shown 
 by Mosca [<a href="#Mosca_thesis">74</a>]. Furthermore, as shown by Watrous 
 [<a href="#Watrous_solvable">91</a>], quantum computers can solve these problems
 using polylog(|<i>G</i>|) queries for any solvable group. For groups given as matrices
 over a finite field rather than oracularly, the order finding and constructive membership
 problems can be solved in polynomial time by using the quantum algorithms for discrete log
 and factoring [<a href="#Babai">124</a>]. See also <a href="#group_isomorphism">group isomorphism</a>.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Group Isomorphism <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Let <i>G</i> be a finite group. To every element of 
<i>G</i> is assigned an arbitrary label (bit string). Given an ordered pair
of labels of group elements, the group oracle returns the label of their
product. Given access to the group oracles for two groups <i>G</i> and 
<i>G'</i>, and a list of generators for each group, we must decide whether
<i>G</i> and <i>G'</i> are isomorphic. For Abelian groups, we can solve this
problem using poly(log |<i>G</i>|, log |<i>G'</i>|) queries to the oracle
by applying the quantum algorithm of [<a href="#Cheung_Mosca">127</a>], which
decomposes any Abelian group into a canonical direct product of cyclic groups.
The quantum algorithm of [<a href="#LeGall">128</a>] solves the group
isomorphism problem using poly(log |<i>G</i>|, log |<i>G'</i>|) queries for a
certain class of non-Abelian groups. Specifically, a group <i>G</i> is in this
class if <i>G</i> has a normal Abelian subgroup <i>A</i> and an element 
<i>y</i> of order coprime to |<i>A</i>| such that G
= <i>A</i>, <i>y</i>. Zatloukal has recently given an exponential
quantum speedup for some instances of a problem closely related to
group isomorphism, namely testing equivalence of group extensions
[<a href="#Z13">202</a>].

<b>Algorithm:</b> Statistical Difference <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Suppose we are given two black boxes <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>
 whose domain is the integers 1 through <i>T</i> and whose range is the integers
 1 through <i>N</i>. By choosing uniformly at random among allowed inputs we obtain a
 probability distribution over the possible outputs. We wish to approximate to constant 
 precision the L1 distance between the probability distributions determined by <i>A</i> 
 and <i>B</i>. Classically the number of necessary queries scales essentially linearly 
 with N. As shown in [<a href="#Bravyi_difference">117</a>], a quantum computer can
 achieve this using \( O(\sqrt{N}) \) queries. Approximate uniformity and orthogonality
 of probability distributions can also be decided on a quantum computer using 
 \( O(N^{1/3}) \) queries. The main tool is the quantum counting algorithm of 
 [<a href="#BHT98">16</a>]. A further improved quantum algorithm for
 this task is obtained in [<a href="#M15b">265</a>].
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Finite Rings and Ideals <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Suppose we are given black boxes implementing the addition and
 multiplication operations on a finite ring <i>R</i>, not necessarily commutative, along
 with a set of generators for <i>R</i>. With respect to addition, <i>R</i> forms a 
 finite Abelian group (<i>R</i>,+). As shown in [<a href="#Arvind">119</a>], on a quantum
 computer one can find in poly(log |<i>R</i>|) time a set of additive generators
 \( \{h_1,\ldots,h_m\} \subset R \) such that 
 \( (R,+) \simeq \langle h_1 \rangle \times \ldots \times \langle h_M \rangle\)
 and <i>m</i> is polylogarithmic in |<i>R</i>|. This allows efficient computation of a 
 multiplication tensor for <i>R</i>. As shown in [<a href="#WJAB">118</a>], one can 
 similarly find an additive generating set for any ideal in <i>R</i>. This allows one 
 to find the intersection of two ideals, find their quotient, prove whether a given ring
 element belongs to a given ideal, prove whether a given element is a unit and if so 
 find its inverse, find the additive and multiplicative identities, compute the order of
 an ideal, solve linear equations over rings, decide whether an ideal is maximal, find 
 annihilators, and test the injectivity and surjectivity of ring homomorphisms. As shown 
 in [<a href="#Arvind2">120</a>], one can also use a quantum computer to efficiently 
 decide whether a given polynomial is identically zero on a given finite black box ring. 
 Known classical algorithms for these problems scale as poly(|<i>R</i>|).

<b>Algorithm:</b> Counterfeit Coins<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> Suppose we are given <i>N</i> coins, <i>k</i> of which are 
 counterfeit. The real coins are all of equal weight, and the counterfeit coins are 
 all of some other equal weight. We have a pan balance and can compare the weight of
 any pair of subsets of the coins. Classically, we need \( \Omega(k \log(N/k)) \)
 weighings to identify all of the counterfeit coins. We can introduce an oracle such
 that given a pair of subsets of the coins of equal cardinality, it outputs one bit
 indicating balanced or unbalanced. Building on previous work by Terhal and Smolin
 [<a href="#TS">137</a>], Iwama <i>et al.</i> have shown [<a href="#Iwama">136</a>] 
 that on a quantum computer, one can identify all of the counterfeit coins using
 \( O(k^{1/4}) \) queries. The core techniques behind the quantum speedup are amplitude
 amplification and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm.<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Matrix Rank<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> Suppose we are given oracle access to the (integer) entries of an
 \( n \times m \)  matrix <i>A</i>. We wish to determine the rank of the matrix. 
 Classically this requires order <i>nm</i> queries. Building on 
 [<a href="#Reichardt2010">149</a>], Belovs [<a href="#Belovs_Rank">150</a>] gives a
 quantum algorithm that can use fewer queries given a promise that the rank of the 
 matrix is at least <i>r</i>. Specifically, Belovs' algorithm uses 
 \( O(\sqrt{r(n-r+1)}LT) \) queries, where <i>L</i> is the root-mean-square
 of the reciprocals of the <i>r</i> largest singular values of <i>A</i> and
 <i>T</i> is a factor that depends on the sparsity of the matrix. For general <i>A</i>,
 \( T = O(\sqrt{nm}) \). If <i>A</i> has at most <i>k</i> nonzero entries in any row or
 column then \( T = O(k \log(n+m)) \). (To achieve the corresponding query complexity in 
 the <i>k</i>-sparse case, the oracle must take a column index as input, and provide a 
 list of the nonzero matrix elements from that column as output.) As an important special
 case, one can use these quantum algorithms for the problem of determining whether a 
 square matrix is singular, which is sometimes referred to as the determinant problem. 
 For general <i>A</i> the quantum query complexity of the determinant  problem is no 
 lower than the classical query complexity [<a href="#Dorn">151</a>]. However, 
 [<a href="#Dorn">151</a>] does not rule out a quantum speedup given a promise on <i>A</i>, 
 such as sparseness or lack of small singular values.<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Matrix Multiplication over Semirings<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> A semiring is a set endowed with addition and
multiplication operations that obey all the axioms of a ring except
the existence additive inverses. Matrix multiplication over various
semirings has many applications to graph problems. Matrix
multiplication over semirings can be sped up by straightforward Grover
improvements upon schoolbook multiplication, yielding a quantum
algorithm that multiplies a pair of \(n \times n\) matrices in \(
\widetilde{O}(n^{5/2}) \) time. For some semirings this algorithm
outperforms the fastest known classical algorithms and for some
semirings it does not [<a href="#LeGall_Nishimura13">206</a>]. 
A case of particular interest is the Boolean semiring, in which OR
serves as addition and AND serves as multiplication. No quantum
algorithm is known for Boolean semiring matrix multiplication in the
general case that beats the best classical algorithm, which has
complexity \( n^{2.373} \). However, for sparse input our output,
quantum speedups are known. Specifically, let <i>A,B</i>
be <i>n</i> by <i>n</i> Boolean matrices. Let <i>C</i>=<i>AB</i>,
and let <i>l</i> be the number of entries of <i>C</i> that are equal
to 1 (<em>i.e.</em> TRUE). Improving upon 
 [<a href="#Buhrman_matrix">19</a>, <a href="#LeGall_Matrix">155</a>, <a href="#Williams_Williams">157</a>],
the best known upper bound on quantum query complexity is
\(\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt{l}) \), as shown in
[<a href="#JKM">161</a>]. If instead the input matrices are sparse, a
quantum speedup over the fastest known classical algorithm also has
been found in a certain regime [<a href="#LeGall_Nishimura13">206</a>].
For detailed comparison to classical algorithms, see
[<a href="#LeGall_Matrix">155</a>, <a href="#LeGall_Nishimura13">206</a>]. Quantum
algorithms have been found to perform matrix multiplication over the
(max,min) semiring in \(\widetilde{O}(n^{2.473})\) time and over the
distance dominance semiring in \(\widetilde{O}(n^{2.458})\) time
[<a href="#LeGall_Nishimura13">206</a>]. The fastest known classical
algorithm for both of these problems has \(\widetilde{O}(n^{2.687})\)
complexity.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Subset finding<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> We are oracle access to a function \( f:D \to R \) where <i>D</i> and
 <i>R</i> are finite sets. Some property \( P \subset (D \times R)^k \) is specified, for 
 example as an explicit list. Our task is to find a size-<i>k</i> subset of <i>D</i> 
 satisfying <i>P</i>, <i>i.e.</i> \( ((x_1,f(x_1)),\ldots,(x_k,f(x_k)))
 \in P \), or reject if none exists. As usual, we wish to do this
 with the minimum number of queries to <i>f</i>. Generalizing the 
 result of [<a href="#Ambainis_distinctness">7</a>], it was shown in 
 [<a href="#Childs_Eisenberg">162</a>] that this can be achieved using
 \(O(|D|^{k/(k+1)}) \) quantum queries. As an noteworthy special case, this algorithm 
 solves the <i>k</i>-subset-sum problem of finding <i>k</i> numbers from a list with some
  desired sum. A matching lower bound for the quantum query complexity is proven in
[<a href="#Belovs_Spalek">163</a>].<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Search with Wildcards<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b>
The search with wildcards problem is to identify a hidden <i>n</i>-bit
string <i>x</i> by making queries to an oracle <i>f</i>. Given \( S
\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,n\} \) and \( y \in \{0,1\}^{|S|} \), <i>f</i>
returns one if the substring of <i>x</i> specified by <i>S</i> is equal
to <i>y</i>, and returns zero otherwise. Classically, this problem has
query complexity \(\Theta(n)\). As shown in
[<a href="#Ambainis_Montanaro12">167</a>], the quantum query
complexity of this problem is \( \Theta(\sqrt{n}) \). Interestingly,
this quadratic speedup is achieved not through amplitude
amplification or quantum walks, but rather through use of the
so-called Pretty Good Measurement. The paper
[<a href="#Ambainis_Montanaro12">167</a>] also gives a quantum speedup
for the related problem of combinatorial group testing. This result
and subsequent faster quantum algorithms for group testing are
discussed in the entry on Junta Testing and Group Testing. 
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm: </b> Network flows <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> A network is a directed graph whose edges are
labeled with numbers indicating their carrying capacities, and two of
whose vertices are designated as the source and the sink. A flow on a
network is an assignment of flows to the edges such that no flow
exceeds that edge's capacity, and for each vertex other than the
source and sink, the total inflow is equal to the total outflow. The
network flow problem is, given a network, to find the flow that maximizes
the total flow going from source to sink. For a network with <i>n</i>
vertices, <i>m</i> edges, and integer capacities of maximum
magnitude <i>U</i>, [<a href="#Ambainis_Spalek05">168</a>]
gives a quantum algorithm to find the maximal flow in time \( O(\min
\{n^{7/6} \sqrt{m} \ U^{1/3}, \sqrt{nU}m\} \times \log n) \). The
network flow problem is closely related to the problem of finding a
maximal matching of a graph, that is, a maximal-size subset of edges
that connects each vertex to at most one other vertex. The paper
[<a href="#Ambainis_Spalek05">168</a>] gives algorithms for finding
maximal matchings that run in time \( O(n \sqrt{m+n} \log n) \) if
the graph is bipartite, and \( O(n^2 ( \sqrt{m/n} + \log n) \log n) \)
in the general case. The core of these algorithms is Grover search. 
The known upper bounds on classical complexity of the network flow and
matching problems are complicated to state because different classical
algorithms are preferable in different parameter regimes. However, in
certain regimes, the above quantum algorithms beat all known classical
algorithms. (See [<a href="#Ambainis_Spalek05">168</a>] for
details.)<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm: </b> Electrical Resistance <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Exponential<br />
<b>Description:</b> 
We are given oracle access to a weighted graph of <i>n</i> vertices and maximum
degree <i>d</i> whose edge weights are to be interpreted as electrical resistances.
Our task is to compute the resistance between a chosen pair of vertices. Wang gave
two quantum algorithms in [<a href="#Wang14">210</a>] for this task that run in time 
\(\mathrm{poly}( \log n, d, 1/\phi, 1/\epsilon) \), where \( \phi \) is the expansion
of the graph, and the answer is to be given to within a factor of \( 1+\epsilon \).
Known classical algorithms for this problem are polynomial in <i>n</i> rather than
\( \log n \). One of Wang's algorithms is based on a novel use of
quantum walks. The other is based on the quantum algorithm of
[<a href="#HHL08">104</a>] for solving linear systems of equations. The first quantum
query complexity upper bounds for the electrical resistance problem in the adjacency
query model are given in [<a href="#IJ15">280</a>] using approximate span programs.

<b>Algorithm: </b> Junta Testing and Group Testing <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> 
A function \(f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\) is a <i>k</i>-junta if it
depends on at most <i>k</i> of its input bits. The <i>k</i>-junta
testing problem is to decide whether a given function is
a <i>k</i>-junta or is \( \epsilon \)-far from
any <i>k</i>-junta. Althoug it is not obvious, this problem is closely
related to group testing. A group testing problem is defined by a
function \(f:\{1,2,\ldots,n\} \to \{0,1\}\). One is given oracle
access to <i>F</i>, which takes as input subsets of 
\( \{1,2,\ldots,n\} \). <i>F</i>(<i>S</i>) = 1 if there exists \(x \in
    S \) such that <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = 1 and 
<i>F</i>(<i>S</i>) = 0 otherwise. In [<a href="#ABRW15">266</a>] a
quantum algorithm is given solving the <i>k</i>-junta problem using 
\( \widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k/\epsilon}) \) queries and 
\( \widetilde{O}(n \sqrt{k/\epsilon}) \) time. This is a quadratic
speedup over the classical complexity, and improves upon a previous
quantum algorithm for <i>k</i>-junta testing given in
[<a href="#AS07">267</a>]. A polynomial speedup for a gapped
(<i>i.e.</i> approximation) version of group testing is also given in
[<a href="#ABRW15">266</a>], improving upon the earlier results of
[<a href="#Ambainis_Montanaro12">167</a>,<a href="#B13">268</a>].

<b>Algorithm:</b> Knot Invariants <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> As shown by 
Freedman [<a href="#Freedman">42</a>,
<a href="#Freedman2">41</a>], <i>et al.</i>, finding a certain additive approximation to the Jones
 polynomial of the plat closure of a braid at \( e^{i 2 \pi/5} \) is a BQP-complete problem. This 
 result was reformulated and extended to \( e^{i 2 \pi/k} \) for arbitrary <i>k</i> by Aharonov 
 <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#Aharonov1">4</a>,<a href="#Aharonov2">2</a>]. Wocjan and Yard further
 generalized this, obtaining a  quantum algorithm to estimate the HOMFLY polynomial 
 [<a href="#Wocjan">93</a>], of which the Jones polynomial is a special case. Aharonov 
 <i>et al.</i> subsequently showed that quantum computers can in polynomial time estimate a
 certain additive approximation to the even more general Tutte polynomial for planar 
 graphs [<a href="#Aharonov3">3</a>]. It is not fully understood for what range of parameters 
 the approximation obtained in [<a href="#Aharonov3">3</a>] is BQP-hard. (See also <a href="#part_func">partition

 discovered for additively approximating link invariants arising from
 quantum doubles of finite groups
 [<a href="#Krovi_Russell12">174</a>]. (This problem is not known to
 be BQP-hard.) As shown in [<a href="#Shor_Jordan">83</a>], the

<b>Algorithm:</b> Three-manifold Invariants <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> The Turaev-Viro invariant is a function that takes
 three-dimensional manifolds as input and produces a real number as output. Homeomorphic
 manifolds yield the same number. Given a three-manifold specified by a Heegaard splitting,
 a quantum computer can efficiently find a certain additive approximation to its
 Turaev-Viro invariant, and this approximation is BQP-complete [<a href="#AJKR">129</a>].
 Earlier, in [<a href="#Garnerone">114</a>], a polynomial-time quantum algorithm was given
 to additively approximate the Witten-Reshitikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariant of a manifold
 given by a surgery presentation. Squaring the WRT invariant yields the Turaev-Viro
 invariant. However, it is unknown whether the approximation achieved in 
 [<a href="#Garnerone">114</a>] is BQP-complete. A suggestion of a possible link between

<b>Algorithm:</b> Partition Functions <br />
<b>Speedup: </b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> For a classical system with a finite set of states <i>S</i> the
 partition function is \( Z = \sum_{s \in S} e^{-E(s)/kT} \), where <i>T</i> is the
 temperature and <i>k</i> is Boltzmann's constant. Essentially every thermodynamic 
 quantity can be calculated by taking an appropriate partial derivative of the partition
 function. The partition function of the Potts model is a special case of the Tutte
 polynomial. A quantum algorithm for approximating the Tutte polynomial is given in 
 [<a href="#Aharonov3">3</a>]. Some connections between these approaches are  discussed
 in [<a href="#Lidar_Ising">67</a>]. Additional algorithms for estimating partition

<b>Algorithm:</b> Quantum Approximate Optimization <br />
<b>Speedup: </b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> For many combinatorial optimization problems,
finding the exact optimal solution is NP-complete. There are also hardness-of-approximation
results proving that finding an approximation with sufficiently
small error bound is NP-complete. For certain problems there is a gap
between the best error bound achieved by a polynomial-time classical
approximation algorithm and the error bound proven to be NP-hard. In
this regime there is potential for exponential speedup by quantum
computation. In [<a href="#FGG14a">242</a>] a new quantum algorithmic
technique called the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) 
was proposed for finding approximate solutions to
combinatorial optimization problems. In [<a href="#FGG14b">243</a>] it
was subsequently shown that QAOA solves a combinatorial
optimization problem called Max E3LIN2 with a better approximation
ratio than any polynomial-time classical algorithm known at the
time. However, an efficient classical algorithm achieving an even
better approximation ratio (in fact, the approximation ratio
saturating the limit set by hardness-of-approximation) was
subsequently discovered [<a href="#BMO15">260</a>]. Presently, the power of
QAOA relative to classical computing is an active area of research 
[<a href="#LZ16">300</a>, <a href="#WHT16">301</a>, <a href="#FH16">302</a>,

<b>Algorithm:</b> Semidefinite Programming <br />

<b>Description:</b> Given a list of <i>m</i> + 1 Hermitian \(n \times n \)
matrices \(C, A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_m\) and <i>m</i> numbers 
\(b_1, \ldots, b_m \), the problem of semidefinite programming is to
find the positive semidefinite \( n \times n \)
matrix <i>X</i> that maximizes tr(<i>CX</i>) subject to the
constraints \( \mathrm{tr} (A_j X) \leq b_j \) for \( j = 1,2,\ldots,

research, combinatorial optimization, and quantum information, and it
includes linear programming as a special case. Introduced in 
[<a href="#BS16">313</a>], and subsequently improved in [<a href="#BKL17">383</a>, <a href="#AGG20">425</a>],
quantum algorithms are now known that can approximately solve semidefinite programs to within \( \pm \epsilon \) in time 
\( O (\sqrt{m} \log m \cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log n, r, \epsilon^{-1})) \), where <i>r</i> is
the rank of the semidefinite program. This constitutes a quadratic speedup over the fastest
classical algorithms when <i>r</i> is small compared to <i>n</i>. The quantum algorithm is
based on amplitude amplification and quantum Gibbs sampling [<a href="#Poulin_Wocjan">121</a>, <a href="#CS16">307</a>].
In a model in which input is provided in the form of quantum states the quantum algorithm
for semidefinite programming can achieve superpolynomial speedup, as discussed in [<a href="#BKL17">383</a>],
although recent dequantization results [<a href="#CGL20">421</a>] delineate limitations on
the context in which superpolynomial quantum speedup for semidefinite programs is possible.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Zeta Functions <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Let  <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) be a degree-<i>d</i>
polynomial over a finite field \( \mathbb{F}_p \). Let \( N_r \) be
the number of projective solutions to <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i> = 0 over the
extension field \( \mathbb{F}_{p^r} \). The zeta function for <i>f</i>
is defined to be \( Z_f(T) = \exp \left( \sum_{r=1}^\infty
\frac{N_r}{r} T^r \right) \). Remarkably, \( Z_f(T) \) always has the
form \( Z_f(T) = \frac{Q_f(T)}{(1-pT)(1-T)} \) where \( Q_f(T) \) is a
polynomial of degree 2<i>g</i> and \(g = \frac{1}{2} (d-1)(d-2) \) is
called the genus of <i>f</i>. Given \( Z_f(T) \) one can easily
compute the number of zeros of <i>f</i> over any extension field \(
\mathbb{F}_{p^r} \). One can similarly define the zeta function
when the original field over which <i>f</i> is defined does not have
prime order. As shown by Kedlaya [<a href="#Kedlaya">64</a>],
quantum computers can determine the zeta function of a genus <i>g</i>
curve over a finite field \( \mathbb{F}_{p^r} \) in 
\( \mathrm{poly}(\log p, r, g) \) time. The fastest known classical algorithms
are all exponential in either log(<i>p</i>) or <i>g</i>. In a
diffent, but somewhat related contex, van Dam has conjectured that due
to a connection between the zeros of <em>Riemann</em> zeta functions
and the eigenvalues of certain quantum operators, quantum computers
might be able to efficiently approximate the number of solutions to
equations over finite fields [<a href="#vanDam_zeros">87</a>].

<b>Algorithm:</b> Weight Enumerators <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Let <i>C</i> be a code on <i>n</i> bits, <i>i.e.</i> a subset of 
 \( \mathbb{Z}_2^n \). The weight enumerator of <i>C</i> is 
 \( S_C(x,y) = \sum_{c \in C} x^{|c|} y^{n-|c|} \) where 
 |<i>c</i>| denotes the Hamming weight of <i>c</i>. Weight enumerators have many
 uses in the study of classical codes. If <i>C</i> is a linear code, it can be defined by
 \( C = \{c: Ac = 0\} \) where <i>A</i> is a matrix over \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \)
 In this case \( S_C(x,y) = \sum_{c:Ac=0} x^{|c|} y^{n-|c|} \). Quadratically signed
 weight enumerators (QWGTs) are a generalization of this: 
 \( S(A,B,x,y) = \sum_{c:Ac=0} (-1)^{c^T B c} x^{|c|} y^{n-|c|} \). Now consider the
 following special case. Let <i>A</i> be an \( n \times n \) matrix over \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \)
 such that diag(<i>A</i>)=I. Let lwtr(<i>A</i>) be the lower triangular matrix resulting
 from setting all entries above the diagonal in <i>A</i> to zero. Let <i>l,k</i> be positive
 integers. Given the promise that 
 \( |S(A,\mathrm{lwtr}(A),k,l)| \geq \frac{1}{2} (k^2+l^2)^{n/2} \)
 the problem of determining the sign of \( S(A,\mathrm{lwtr}(A),k,l) \) is  BQP-complete,
 as shown by Knill and Laflamme in [<a href="#Knill_QWGT">65</a>]. The evaluation of QWGTs is
 also closely related to the evaluation of Ising and Potts model partition functions 
 [<a href="#Lidar_Ising">67</a>,<a href="#Geraci_QWGT1">45</a>,<a href="#Geraci_QWGT2">46</a>].

<b>Algorithm:</b> Simulated Annealing <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> In simulated annealing, one has a series of Markov chains defined by
 stochastic matrices \( M_1, M_2,\ldots,M_n \). These are slowly varying in the sense that
 their limiting distributions \( pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots, \pi_n \) satisfy
 \( |\pi_{t+1} -\pi_t| \lt \epsilon \) for some small \( \epsilon \).
 These distributions can often be thought of as thermal distributions at successively lower
 temperatures. If \( \pi_1 \) can be easily prepared, then by applying this
 series of Markov chains one can sample from \( \pi_n \). Typically, one wishes for
 \( \pi_n \) to be a distribution over good solutions to some optimization problem. Let 
 \( \delta_i \) be the gap between the largest and second largest eigenvalues of
 \( M_i \). Let \( \delta = \min_i \delta_i \). The run time of this classical algorithm
 is proportional to \(  1/\delta \). Building upon results of Szegedy 
 [<a href="#Szegedy_arxiv">135</a>,<a href="#Szegedy">85</a>], Somma <i>et al.</i> have 
 shown [<a href="#Somma">84</a>, <a href="#SBBK08">177</a>] that
 quantum computers can sample from \( \pi_n \) with a runtime
 proportional to \( 1/\sqrt{\delta} \). Additional methods by which
 classical Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms can be sped up using
 quantum walks are given in [<a href="#M15b">265</a>].
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> String Rewriting <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> String rewriting is a fairly general model of computation. String
 rewriting systems (sometimes called grammars) are specified by a list of rules by which
 certain substrings are allowed to be replaced by certain other substrings. For example,
 context free grammars, are equivalent to the pushdown automata. In
 [<a href="#Wocjan_strings">59</a>], Janzing and Wocjan showed that a certain string
 rewriting problem is PromiseBQP-complete. Thus quantum computers can solve it in
 polynomial time, but classical computers probably cannot. Given three strings
 <i>s,t,t'</i>, and a set of string rewriting rules satisfying certain promises, the
 problem is to find a certain approximation to the difference between the number of
 ways of obtaining <i>t</i> from <i>s</i> and the number of ways of obtaining <i>t'</i>
 from <i>s</i>. Similarly, certain problems of approximating the difference in number of
 paths between pairs of vertices in a graph, and difference in transition probabilities
 between pairs of states in a random walk are also BQP-complete
 [<a href="#Wocjan_walks">58</a>].
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Matrix Powers <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Quantum computers have an exponential advantage in approximating
 matrix elements of powers of exponentially large sparse matrices. Suppose we are have
 an \( N \times N \) symmetric matrix <i>A</i> such that there are at most polylog(<i>N</i>)
 nonzero entries in each row, and given a row index, the set of nonzero entries can be
 efficiently computed. The task is, for any 1 &lt; <i>i</i> &lt; <i>N</i>, and any <i>m</i>
 polylogarithmic in <i>N</i>, to approximate \( (A^m)_{ii} \) the \( i^{\mathrm{th}} \)
 diagonal matrix element of \( A^m \). The approximation is additive to within
 \( b^m \epsilon \) where <i>b</i> is a given upper bound on |<i>A</i>| and \( \epsilon \)
 is of order 1/polylog(<i>N</i>). As shown by Janzing and Wocjan, this problem is
 PromiseBQP-complete, as is the corresponding problem for off-diagonal matrix elements
 [<a href="#Wocjan_matrix">60</a>]. Thus, quantum computers can solve it in polynomial
 time, but classical computers probably cannot.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Constraint Satisfaction <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Constraint satisfaction problems, many of which
are NP-hard, are ubiquitous in computer science, a canonical example
being 3-SAT. If one wishes to satisfy as many constraints as possible
rather than all of them, these become combinatorial optimization
problems. (See also <a href="#adiabiatic">adiabatic algorithms</a>.) The brute force
solution to constraint satisfaction problems can be quadratically sped
up using Grover's algorithm. However, most constraint satisfaction
problems are solvable by classical algorithms that (although still
exponential-time) run more than quadratically faster than brute force
checking of all possible solutions. Nevertheless, a polynomial quantum
speedup over the fastest known classical algorithm for 3-SAT is given
in [<a href="#Ambainis_SIGACT">133</a>], and polynomial quantum
speedups for some other constraint satisfaction problems are given in
[<a href="#CGF">134</a>, <a href="#MGAG15">298</a>]. In [<a href="#BKF19">423</a>] a quadratic
quantum speedup for approximate solutions to homogeneous QUBO/Ising problems
is obtained by building upon the quantum algorithm for semidefinite programming.
A commonly used classical algorithm for constraint satisfaction is
backtracking, and for some problems this algorithm is the fastest known. 
A general quantum speedup for backtracking algorithms is given in
[<a href="#M15a">264</a>] and further improved in [<a href="#AK17">422</a>].<br /><br />

<a name="adiabatic"></a>
<b>Algorithm:</b> Adiabatic Algorithms <br />
<b>Speedup: </b> Unknown <br />
<b>Description:</b> In adiabatic quantum computation one starts with
an initial Hamiltonian whose ground state is easy to prepare, and
slowly varies the Hamiltonian to one whose ground state encodes the
solution to some computational problem. By the adiabatic theorem, the
system will track the instantaneous ground state provided the
variation of the Hamiltonian is sufficiently slow. The runtime of an
adiabatic algorithm scales at worst as \(1/ \gamma^3 \) where \( \gamma \)
is the minimum eigenvalue gap between the ground state
and the first excited state [<a href="#JRS06">185</a>]. If the
Hamiltonian is varied sufficiently smoothly, one can improve this to
\( \widetilde{O}(1/\gamma^2) \) [<a href="#EH12">247</a>]. Adiabatic
quantum computation was first proposed by Farhi <i>et al.</i> as a
method for solving NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems
[<a href="#Farhi_adiabatic">96</a>, <a href="#FGGLLP01">186</a>]. Adiabatic quantum algorithms for
optimization problems typically use "stoquastic" Hamiltonians, which
do not suffer from the sign problem. Such algorithms are sometimes
referred to as quantum annealing. Adiabatic quantum computation with
non-stoquastic Hamiltonians is as powerful as the quantum circuit 
model [<a href="#Aharonov_adiabatic">97</a>]. Adiabatic algorithms
using stoquastic Hamiltonians are probably less powerful
[<a href="#BDOT06">183</a>], but are likely more powerful
than classical computation [<a href="#H20a">429</a>]. The asymptotic runtime of adiabatic
optimization algorithms is notoriously difficult to analyze, but some
progress has been achieved
[<a href="#AKR09">179</a>,<a href="#R04">180</a>,<a href="#FGG02">181</a>,<a href="#FGGGMS09">182</a>,<a href="#FGGN05">187</a>,<a href="#FGGS10">188</a>,<a href="#FGG02B">189</a>,<a href="#vDMV01">190</a>,<a href="#FGHSSYZ12">191</a>,<a href="#IM08">226</a>]. (Also
relevant is an earlier literature on quantum annealing, which
originally referred to a classical optimization algorithm that works by 
simulating a quantum process, much as simulated annealing is a
classical optimization algorithm that works by simulating a thermal
process. See <em>e.g.</em>
[<a href="#FGSSD94">199</a>, <a href="#MN08">198</a>].) Adiabatic quantum
computers can perform a process somewhat analogous
to Grover search in \( O(\sqrt{N}) \) time
[<a href="#Roland_Cerf">98</a>]. Adiabatic quantum algorithms
achieving quadratic speedup for a more general class of problems are
constructed in [<a href="#SB12">184</a>] by adapting techniques from
[<a href="#Szegedy">85</a>]. Adiabatic quantum algorithms have been
proposed for several specific problems, including PageRank
[<a href="#GZL12">176</a>], machine learning
[<a href="#PL12">192</a>, <a href="#NDRM08">195</a>], finding Hadamard
matrices [<a href="#SM19">406</a>], and graph problems [<a href="#GC11">193</a>, <a href="#GC13">194</a>].
Some quantum simulation algorithms also use adiabatic state
preparation.

<b>Algorithm:</b> Gradients, Structured Search, and Learning Polynomials<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial <br />
<b>Description:</b> Suppose we are given a oracle for computing some smooth function
\( f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R} \). The inputs and outputs to <i>f</i> are given to 
the oracle with finitely many bits of precision. The task is to estimate \( \nabla f \)
at some specified point \( \mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d \). As shown in 
[<a href="#Jordan_gradient">61</a>], a quantum computer can achieve this using one query,
whereas a classical computer needs at least <i>d+1</i> queries. In [<a href="#Bulger">20</a>],
Bulger suggested potential applications for optimization problems. As shown in appendix D
of [<a href="#mythesis">62</a>], a quantum computer can use the gradient algorithm to find
the minimum of a quadratic form in <i>d</i> dimensions using <i>O(d)</i> queries, whereas,
as shown in [<a href="#Yao">94</a>], a classical computer needs at least \( \Omega(d^2) \)
queries. Single query quantum algorithms for finding the minima of basins based on Hamming 
distance were given in
[<a href="#Hogg">147</a>,<a href="#Hunziker_Meyer">148</a>,<a href="#MP09">223</a>].
The quantum algorithm of [<a href="#mythesis">62</a>] can also extract all \( d^2 \)
matrix elements of the quadratic form using <i>O(d)</i> queries, and  more generally, all
\( d^n \) <i>n</i>th derivatives of a smooth function of <i>d</i> variables in \( O(d^{n-1}) \)
queries. Remarkably general results in [<a href="#CML18">418</a>,<a href="#CMH19">419</a>,<a href="#AGG18">420</a>]
give quantum speedups for convex optimization and volume estimation of convex bodies, as well
as query complexity lower bounds. Roughly speaking these results show that for convex
optimization and volume estimation in <i>d</i> dimensions one gets a quadratic speedup in <i>d</i>
just as was found earlier for the special case of minimizing quadratic forms.
As shown in [<a href="#Roetteler_quad">130</a>,<a href="#Montanaro_polynomials">146</a>],
quadratic forms and multilinear polynomials in <i>d</i> variables over a finite field may 
be extracted with a factor of <i>d</i> fewer quantum queries than are required classically.
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Linear Systems<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> We are given oracle access to an \( n \times n \) matrix <i>A</i> and 
some description of a vector <i>b</i>. We wish to find some property of <i>f(A)b</i> 
for some efficiently computable function <i>f</i>.  Suppose <i>A</i> is a Hermitian matrix
with  <i>O</i>(polylog <i>n</i>) nonzero entries in each row and condition number <i>k</i>.
As shown in [<a href="#HHL08">104</a>], a quantum computer can in \( O(k^2 \log n) \)
time compute to polynomial precision various expectation values of operators with respect
to the vector <i>f(A)b</i> (provided that a quantum state proportional to <i>b</i> is 
efficiently constructable). For certain functions, such as <i>f(x)=1/x</i>, this
procedure can be extended to non-Hermitian and even non-square <i>A</i>. The 
runtime of this algorithm was subsequently improved to \( O(k \log^3 k \log n) \)
in [<a href="#Ambainis_linear">138</a>]. Exponentially improved
scaling of runtime with precision was obtained in
[<a href="#CKS15">263</a>]. Some methods to extend this algorithm to apply to non-sparse matrices
have been proposed [<a href="#KP16">309</a>,<a href="#WZP17">402</a>], although these require certain partial sums of the matrix elements to
be pre-computed. Extensions of this quantum algorithm have been applied to problems of estimating electromagnetic
scattering crossections [<a href="#CJS13">249</a>] (see also [<a href="#CJO17">369</a>] for a different approach), solving linear
differential equations [<a href="#Berry10">156</a>, <a href="#MP16">296</a>], estimating
electrical resistance of networks [<a href="#Wang14">210</a>], least-squares
curve-fitting [<a href="#Wiebe_Braun_Lloyd12">169</a>], solving Toeplitz systems 
[<a href="#WYPGW16">297</a>], and machine learning 
[<a href="#LMR13">214</a>,<a href="#LGZ14">222</a>,<a href="#LMR13b">250</a>,<a href="#RML13">251</a>,<a href="#KP16">309</a>].
However, the linear-systems-based quantum algorithms for recommendation systems [<a href="#KP16">309</a>]
and principal component analysis [<a href="#LMR13b">250</a>] were subsequently "dequantized" by Tang
[<a href="#Tang18a">400</a>, <a href="#Tang18b">401</a>].
That is, Tang obtained polynomial time classical randomized algorithms for these problems, thus proving
that the proposed quantum algorithms for these tasks do not achieve exponential speedup.
Some limitations of the quantum machine learning algorithms based on
linear systems are nicely summarized in [<a href="#Aa15">246</a>].
In [<a href="#Ta-Shma13">220</a>] it was  shown that quantum
computers can invert well-conditioned  \( n \times n \) matrices
using only \( O( \log n ) \) qubits, whereas the best classical
algorithm uses order \( \log^2 n \) bits. Subsequent improvements to
this quantum algorithm are given in [<a href="#FL16">279</a>].

<b>Algorithm: </b> Machine Learning <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Varies<br />
<b>Description:</b> 
Maching learning encompasses a wide variety of computational problems
and can be attacked by a wide variety of algorithmic techniques. This
entry summarizes quantum algorithmic techniques for improved machine
learning. Many of the quantum algorithms here are cross-listed under
other headings. In
[<a href="#LMR13">214</a>,<a href="#LGZ14">222</a>,<a href="#LMR13b">250</a>,<a href="#RML13">251</a>,<a href="#KP16">309</a>,<a href="#SSP16">338</a>,<a href="#ZFF15">339</a>,<a href="#KP17">359</a>,<a href="#ZPK19">403</a>],
quantum algorithms for solving linear systems [<a href="#HHL08">104</a>] are
applied to speed up cluster-finding, principal component analysis,
binary classification, training of neural networks, and various forms of regression, provided the data satisfies certain conditions. However, a number of quantum machine learning algorithms based on
linear systems have subsequently been "dequantized". Specifically, Tang showed in [<a href="#Tang18a">400</a>, <a href="#Tang18b">401</a>] that the 
problems of recommendation systems and principal component analysis solved by the quantum algorithms of [<a href="#RML13">251</a>,<a href="#KP16">309</a>] can in fact also be solved in polynomial time randomized classical algorithms.
A cluster-finding method not based on the linear systems algorithm of [<a href="#HHL08">104</a>] is given in [<a href="#WKS15">336</a>]. The papers 
[<a href="#PL12">192</a>,<a href="#NDRM08">195</a>,<a href="#CLGOR16">344</a>,<a href="#AH15">345</a>,<a href="#BRRP16">346</a>,<a href="#AARBM16">348</a>]
explore the use of adiabatic optimization techniques to speed up the training of
classifiers. In [<a href="#WKS14">221</a>], a method is proposed for
training Boltzmann machines by manipulating coherent quantum states
with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weights. Polynomial speedups
can be obtained by applying Grover search and related techniques such as amplitude amplification to amenable
subroutines of state of the art classical machine learning algorithms. See,
for example 
[<a href="#ABG07">358</a>,<a href="#ABG13">340</a>,<a href="#WKS16">341</a>,<a href="#PDMMB14">342</a>,<a href="#DCLT08">343</a>].
Other quantum machine learning algorithms not falling into one of the above categories include 
[<a href="#YBLL14">337</a>,<a href="#WG17">349</a>].
Some limitations of quantum machine learning algorithms are nicely
summarized in [<a href="#Aa15">246</a>]. Many other quantum query algorithms that extract hidden structure of the
black-box function could be cast as machine learning algorithms. See for example
[<a href="#Montanaro_polynomials">146</a>,<a href="#Childs_nonlinear">23</a>,<a href="#Bernstein_Vazirani">11</a>,<a href="#Wocjan_nonlinear">31</a>,<a href="#DHIS13">212</a>]. 
Query algorithms for learning the majority and "battleship" functions are
given in [<a href="#HMPPR03">224</a>]. Large quantum advantages for
learning from noisy oracles are given in [<a href="#CSS14">236</a>,<a href="#HR11">237</a>]. In [<a href="#LAT20">428</a>] quantum kernel estimation is used to implement
a support-vector classifier solving a learning problem that is provably as hard as discrete logarithm. Several recent review articles 
[<a href="#Ad15">299</a>,<a href="#SSP14">332</a>,<a href="#BWPRWL16">333</a>]
and a book [<a href="#QMLbook">331</a>] are available which summarize the state of the field.
There is a related body of work, not strictly within the standard setting of quantum algorithms,
regarding quantum learning in the case that the data itself is quantum coherent. 
See <i>e.g.</i> [<a href="#BJ99">350</a>,<a href="#ABG06">334</a>,<a href="#DTB16">335</a>,<a href="#AW17">351</a>,<a href="#SG04">352</a>,<a href="#AW16">353</a>,<a href="#MSW16">354</a>,<a href="#BCDFP10">355</a>,<a href="#SCJ01">356</a>,<a href="#SC02">357</a>].

<b>Algorithm: </b> Tensor Principal Component Analysis <br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial (quartic)<br />
<b>Description:</b>
In [<a href="#H19">424</a>] a quantum algorithm is given for an idealized problem motivated by machine learning
applications on high-dimensional data sets. Consider \(T = \lambda v_{\mathrm{sig}}^{\otimes p} + G \) where
<i>G</i> is a <i>p</i>-index tensor of Gaussian random variables, symmetrized over all permutations of indices, and
\(v_{\mathrm{sig}}\) is an <i>N</i>-dimensional vector of magnitude \(\sqrt{N}\). The task is to recover \(v_{\mathrm{sig}}\).
Consider \( \lambda = \alpha N^{-p/4}\). The best classical algorithms succeed when \( \alpha \gg 1\) and have time and
space complexity that scale exponentially in \( \alpha^{-1}\). The quantum algorithm of [<a href="#H19">424</a>] solves
this problem in polynomial space and with runtime scaling quartically better in \( \alpha^{-1} \) than the classical spectral
algorithm. The quantum algorithm works by encoding the problem into the eigenspectrum of a many-body Hamiltonian and applying
phase estimation together with amplitude amplification.
<br /><br />

<b>Algorithm:</b> Solving Differential Equations<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Superpolynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> Consider linear first order differential equation \( \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{x} = A(t) \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}(t) \), where
\( \mathbf{x} \) and \( \mathbf{b} \) are <i>N</i>-dimensional vectors and <i>A</i> is an \(N \times N\) matrix. Given an initial condition
\( \mathbf{x}(0) \) one wishes to compute the solution \( \mathbf{x}(t) \) at some later time <i>t</i> to some precision \( \epsilon \) in
the sense that the normalized vector \( x(t)/\|x(t)\| \) produced has distance at most \( \epsilon \) from the exact solution. In [<a href="#Berry10">156</a>],
Berry gives a quantum algorithm for this problem that runs in time \( O(t^2 \mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon) \mathrm{poly log} N) \), whereas the fastest classical algorithms
run in time \( O ( t \mathrm{poly} N ) \). The final result is produced in the form of a quantum superposition state on \( O(log N) \) qubits whose amplitudes contain
the components of \( \mathbf{x}(t) \). The algorithm works by reducing the problem to linear algebra via a high-order finite difference method and applying
the quantum linear algebra primitive of [<a href="#HHL08">104</a>]. In [<a href="#BCOW17">410</a>] an improved quantum algorithm for this problem was given
which brings the epsilon dependence down to \( \mathrm{poly log}(1/\epsilon) \). A quantum algorithm for solving nonlinear differential equations (again in the
sense of obtaining a solution encoded in the amplitudes) is described in [<a href="#LO08">411</a>], which has exponential scaling in <i>t</i>. 
In [<a href="#LKK20">426</a>,<a href="#LDP20">427</a>] quantum algorithms are given for solving nonlinear differential equations that scale as \( O(t^2) \).
These are applicable to a restricted class of nonlinear differential equations. In particular, their solutions must not grow or shrink in magnitude too rapidly.
Partial differential equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations through discretization, and higher order differential equations can be
reduced to first order through additiona of auxiliary variables. Consequently, these more general problems can be solved through the methods of
[<a href="#Berry10">156</a>, <a href="#HHL08">104</a>]. However, quantum algorithms designed to solve these problems directly may be more
efficient (and for specific problems one may analyze the complexity of tasks that are unspecified in a more general formulation such as
preparation of relevant initial states). In [<a href="#CJS13">249</a>] a quantum algorithm is given which solves the wave equation by
applying finite-element methods to reduce it to linear algebra and then applying the quantum linear algebra algorithm of [<a href="#HHL08">104</a>]
with preconditioning. In [<a href="#CJO17">369</a>] a quantum algorithm is given for solving the wave equation by discretizing it
with finite differences and massaging it into the form of a Schrodinger equation which is then simulated using the method of [<a href="#BCK15">245</a>]. The
problem solved by [<a href="#CJO17">369</a>] is not equivalent to that solved by [<a href="#CJS13">249</a>] because in [<a href="#CJS13">249</a>] the problem
is reduced to a time-indepent one through assuming sinusoidal time dependence and applying separation of variables, whereas [<a href="#CJO17">369</a>] solves
the time-dependent problem. The quantum speedup achieved over classical methods for solving the wave equation in <i>d</i>-dimensiona is polynomial for fixed
<i>d</i> but expontial in <i>d</i>. Concrete resource estimates for quantum algorithms to solve differential equations are given in 
[<a href="#CPP13">412</a>, <a href="#WWL19">413</a>, <a href="#SVM17">414</a>]. A quantum algorithm for solving linear partial differential equations using
continuous-variable quantum computing is given in [<a href="#AKW19">415</a>]. In [<a href="#MP16">296</a>] quantum finite element methods are analyzed in
a general setting. A quantum spectral method for solving differential equations is given in [<a href="#CL19">416</a>]. A quantum algorithm for solving the Vlasov equation is
given in [<a href="#ESP19">417</a>].

<b>Algorithm:</b> Quantum Dynamic Programming<br />
<b>Speedup:</b> Polynomial<br />
<b>Description:</b> In [<a href="#ABI18">409</a>] the authors introduce a problem called path-in-the-hypercube. In this problem, one given
a subgraph of the hypercube and asked whether there is a path along this subgraph that starts from the all zeros vertex,
ends at the all ones vertex, and makes only Hamming weight increasing moves. (The vertices of the hypercube graph correspond
to bit strings of length <i>n</i> and the hypercube graph joins vertices of Hamming distance one.) Many NP-complete problems
for which the best classical algorithm is dynamic programming can be modeled as instances of path-in-the-hypercube. By
combining Grover search with dynamic programming methods, a quantum algorithm can solve path-in-the-hypercube in time
\( O^*(1.817^n) \), where the notation \( O^* \) indicates that polynomial factors are being omitted. The fastest known
classical algorithm for this problem runs in time \( O^*(2^n) \). Using this primitive quantum algorithms can be constructed
that solve vertex ordering problems in \( O^*(1.817^n) \) vs. \( O^* (2^n) \) classically, graph bandwidth in \( O^*(2.946^n) \)
vs. \( O^*(4.383^n) \) classically, travelling salesman and feedback arc set in \( O^*(1.729^n) \) vs. \( O^*(2^n) \) classically,
and minimum set cover in \( O( \mathrm{poly}(m,n) 1.728^n ) \) vs. \( O(nm2^n) \) classically.

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>If there exists a positive constant \( \alpha \)
such that the runtime \( C(n) \) of the best known classical algorithm and the runtime
\( Q(n) \) of the quantum algorithm satisfy \( C = 2^{\Omega(Q^\alpha)} \)
then I call the speedup superpolynomial. Otherwise I call it polynomial. 
For a review of the \( O, \Omega, \Theta, \widetilde{O}, ... \) notations see the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
